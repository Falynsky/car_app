# cars_app
Recruitment project for a Flutter developer

## Getting Started
This application uses FVM for Flutter version 3.13.0.

## The project uses translations from easy_localization. Commands to generate translations can be found in the assets directory.

## What would I change?
While writing the application, various ideas came to mind that I implemented or didn't have time for due to work and other commitments. However, I am happy to share them in a technical interview :).

## Running the tests
Various tests have been added. With more time, tests for all classes would be included.
